# Quantum-Computer-Simulator
Python 3 simulation of an ideal quantum computer. Currently only works for single qubits. Working on multi-qubit operations.

Answer "1" for the number of qubits you want to simulate, and do not enter "control" or "target" when given options for gates. Please report any bugs you may find - it would be much appreciated.
